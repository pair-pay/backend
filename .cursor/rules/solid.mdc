Follow the SOLID principles:

- Single Responsibility Principle
A class should have only one reason to change.

- Open/Closed Principle
Software should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

- Liskov Substitution Principle
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

- Interface Segregation Principle
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

- Dependency Inversion Principle
Depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations.
