# Folder structure rule for the application layer

All folders in the `application` layer that contain handlers (commands, queries, event-handlers) must be organized following a modular structure by use case. Each use case will have its own subfolder, which will contain:

- The corresponding handler (command-handler, query-handler, event-handler)
- The definition file (command, query, event)
- The unit tests for that handler

Example:

```
application/
  commands/
    create-member/
      create-member.command.ts
      create-member.command-handler.ts
      create-member.command-handler.spec.ts
    delete-membership/
      delete-membership.command.ts
      delete-membership.command-handler.ts
      delete-membership.command-handler.spec.ts
  queries/
    get-all-memberships/
      get-all-memberships.query.ts
      get-all-memberships.query-handler.ts
      get-all-memberships.query-handler.spec.ts
    ...
  event-handlers/
    membership-created/
      membership-created.event-handler.ts
      membership-created.event-handler.spec.ts
    membership-deleted/
      membership-deleted.event-handler.ts
      membership-deleted.event-handler.spec.ts
```

This structure must be maintained to ensure scalability, clarity, and maintainability of the code in the application layer.
