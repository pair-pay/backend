# pnpm Package Manager Rule

This repository must always use pnpm as the package manager for all dependency management tasks. The following guidelines apply:

- All dependency installation, removal, and update commands must use pnpm (e.g., `pnpm install`, `pnpm add`, `pnpm remove`, `pnpm update`).
- Do not use npm or yarn for any package management operations.
- If any script, documentation, or instruction references npm or yarn, it must be adapted to use pnpm instead.
- The lockfile (`pnpm-lock.yaml`) must be committed and kept up to date.
- All contributors must have pnpm installed locally to work with this repository.

This rule ensures consistency, performance, and reliability in dependency management across the project.
